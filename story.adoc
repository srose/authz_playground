== Authorization? Clarify: what is authorization...
Using OAuth2?

Not really, so even just checking for a token is somehow authorization?

I use the authorization header !!!

UMA?

== I dont have a problem/Thats just the way we used to do it since foreever/Pragmatic: Just do what is necessary...
Seen in code?
- Check JWT, check context, check resource with if,if,if
- Framework agnostic stuff: Roles/Annotations
- There is always something extra beside we do X?

=== Downsides
Not reusable
Not testable in isolation?
...
Lets see what serious authorization has a lot more requirements?
(Is this a pattern? Ah I think know enough until i have a closer look?)

== Data? Model? Functional requirements
RBAC?

== Examples: secure an app using an external service...

TODO Setup the required link:./services.adoc[services].

=== Example 1
